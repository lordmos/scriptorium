# 📚 Multi-Agent Editorial Framework for Technical Books

> **A multi-agent collaborative writing framework for the "Source Code Reading" series of technical books**

## 1. Framework Overview

This framework provides a complete multi-agent editorial workflow for "Source Code Reading" series technical books. Through the collaboration of **12 AI Agents**, it covers the entire pipeline from outline design to final publication.

Core philosophy:

> **Agents are stateless; the file system is stateful.**

Each Agent is a one-time worker — it has no memory of what it did before. All "memory" that must persist across invocations is stored in the shared file system. The main orchestrating Agent precisely injects the context each Agent needs via **File Pointers** (file path references), ensuring information flow is controlled and traceable.

---

## 2. Use Cases

This framework is suited for the following types of technical book projects:

- ✅ **Open-source project source code reading** books (e.g., *Deep Dive into {{项目名称}} Source Code*)
- ✅ Architecture analysis books that dissect a large code repository chapter by chapter
- ✅ Technical explainers for multi-level audiences (students, engineers, enthusiasts)
- ✅ Long-form technical writing projects that require multi-person collaboration with a controlled workflow

**Not suitable for**: purely theoretical textbooks, API reference documentation, short technical blog posts.

---

## 3. System Architecture Overview

This framework uses a **Hub-Spoke architecture**:

```
                    ┌─────────────┐
                    │  主编排 #0   │  ← Hub
                    │ Orchestrator│
                    └──────┬──────┘
           ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
           │               │               │
      ┌────▼────┐    ┌─────▼────┐    ┌─────▼────┐
      │ Agent A │    │ Agent B  │    │ Agent C  │  ← Spokes
      └─────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘
```

- **Main Orchestrator (#0)** is the sole scheduling hub; all sub-Agents communicate only with the Orchestrator
- Sub-Agents **do not communicate directly with each other** — they exchange information through the shared file system
- The Orchestrator uses **File Pointers** to precisely control each Agent's read/write scope, preventing information overload

## 5. Five-Phase Workflow Overview

```
Phase 1 ──→ Phase 2 ──→ Phase 3 ──→ Phase 4 ──→ Phase 5
Outline     Shared      Chapter-by-  Comprehen-  Binding &
Finalized   Resources   Chapter      sive Audit  Publishing
            Built       Writing
```

### Phase 1: Outline Finalization

**Agents involved**: #1 Architect, #2 Reader Advocate, R3 Content Reviewer

The Architect designs the chapter outline and knowledge graph based on the source code structure. The Reader Advocate proposes revisions from the target reader's perspective. The Content Reviewer conducts an initial review of the outline. The final output is a user-approved `outline.md`.

### Phase 2: Shared Resource Building

**Agents involved**: #0 Orchestrator (executing directly)

Based on the finalized outline, this phase builds all shared resource files needed by subsequent Agents:

- `source-map.md` — source directory structure and core module descriptions
- `glossary.md` — book-wide unified terminology table
- `metaphor-registry.md` — metaphor registry (prevents cross-chapter metaphor conflicts)
- `style-guide.md` — writing style guide
- `cross-references.md` — cross-chapter reference register

### Phase 3: Chapter-by-Chapter Writing (×{{章节数}} chapters)

Each chapter goes through 4 steps in sequence:

| Step | Agent | Output |
|------|-------|------|
| Step 1 — Source Research | #3 Researcher | `research/chXX-research.md` |
| Step 2 — Chapter Writing | #4 Writer | `chapters/chXX.md` |
| Step 3 — Three-Way Review | R1 + R2 + R3 (parallel) | Individual review reports |
| Step 4 — Reader Review | RS + RE + RH (parallel) | Individual reader feedback |

> 💡 **Parallelization**: The three reviewers in Step 3 can work simultaneously (different data dependencies); the three reader reviewers in Step 4 can also run in parallel. Multiple chapters can also be processed in batches in parallel (e.g., {{并行批次数}} chapters per batch).

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Audit

**Agents involved**: #0 Orchestrator, R1 + R2 + R3 (re-review)

Performs a final audit of the entire book: terminology consistency, cross-chapter reference completeness, code snippet accuracy, and overall narrative coherence.

### Phase 5: Binding & Publishing

**Agents involved**: #11 Bookbinder

Executes Markdown → HTML conversion, **Mermaid diagram rendering** (via Mermaid.js), ASCII art → SVG rendering (for legacy content compatibility), table of contents generation, and style application. Produces a publishable static website.

### Subdirectory Descriptions

| Directory | Purpose |
|------|------|
| `agents/` | Full spec for each Agent: system prompt templates, input/output specs, File Pointers checklist, quality checkpoints |
| `framework/` | General workflow docs independent of specific Agents: phase breakdown, review protocols, file format specs, collaboration mechanisms |
| `templates/` | Template files to fill in when starting a new project, containing `{{变量}}` placeholders; once filled in they become project shared resources |

---

## 7. Quick Start

### Step 1: Copy the Framework

```bash
cp -r tech-editorial/ {{你的项目路径}}/editorial/
```

### Step 2: Fill in the Templates

Go to the `templates/` directory and fill in the core templates:

| Template File | Content to Fill In |
|---------|--------------|
| `source-map.md` | Target source code directory structure, core module descriptions, key file paths |
| `outline.md` | Initial chapter outline (can be generated with assistance from the Architect Agent) |
| `style-guide.md` | Writing style preferences, code presentation rules, reader positioning |
| `glossary.md` | Initial translations/definitions of known terms (Agents will add more later) |
| `metaphor-registry.md` | Leave blank; fill in progressively during the writing process |

### Step 3: Configure the Orchestrator Agent

In the startup prompt for the Orchestrator Agent, set the following project parameters:

```yaml
项目名称: {{项目名称}}
源码仓库: {{源码仓库地址}}
源码版本: {{源码版本/commit}}
章节总数: {{章节数}}
并行批次: {{并行批次数}}  # 每批同时写作的章节数
目标读者: {{目标读者描述}}
输出目录: {{输出目录路径}}
```

### Step 4: Advance Phase by Phase

Execute Phases 1 → 5 in sequence. Confirm deliverables after each Phase before proceeding to the next:

1. **Phase 1**: Launch Architect → Reader Advocate reviews → User approves outline
2. **Phase 2**: Orchestrator generates shared resource files
3. **Phase 3**: Chapter by chapter (or in parallel batches): Research → Write → Review → Reader Review
4. **Phase 4**: Full-book comprehensive audit
5. **Phase 5**: Bookbinder generates HTML publication

## 8. Core Design Principles

### Principle 1: Agents Are Stateless; the File System Is Stateful

Each Agent is "brand new" on every invocation — it does not remember previous conversations. All information that must persist across invocations (progress, review results, glossary…) must be written to the file system. This means:
- Any Agent instance can be replaced
- Failure recovery only requires re-invoking; no need to replay conversation history

### Principle 2: All Agents Communicate Only with the Orchestrator (Hub-Spoke)

Sub-Agents do not interact directly with each other. The Orchestrator is the sole scheduling hub, responsible for:
- Deciding which Agent to invoke
- Injecting required context via File Pointers
- Collecting outputs and deciding the next step

### Principle 3: File Pointers Precisely Control Read/Write Scope

Each Agent is explicitly told:
- **Required reads**: files that must be read before executing the task
- **Writable files**: file paths that may be written to or modified
- **Off-limits files**: files that must not be modified

This prevents Agents from producing low-quality output due to information overload, and prevents accidental writes.

### Principle 4: Long-Term Memory Is Implemented via Shared Files

Agent A writes its output to a file → the Orchestrator injects that file as a File Pointer into Agent B → Agent B gains Agent A's "memory." Typical shared files include:
- `chapter-summaries.md` — summaries of completed chapters
- `glossary.md` — book-wide terminology table
- `metaphor-registry.md` — registry of metaphors already used
- `cross-references.md` — cross-chapter reference relationships

### Principle 5: Review and Writing Are Separated and Support Parallelism

The three reviewers (R1 Code, R2 Consistency, R3 Content) check different dimensions with non-overlapping data dependencies, so they can **run in parallel**. Likewise, the three reader reviewers (RS/RE/RH) can also run in parallel. This significantly reduces the processing time per chapter.

### Principle 6: Checkpoints Are Recoverable

The file system state fully reflects project progress. If the workflow is interrupted (Agent failure, manual pause, etc.), the Orchestrator can infer the current progress by examining existing files and resume from the checkpoint — no need to start over.
